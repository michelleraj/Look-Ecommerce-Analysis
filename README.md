### 💡 Cohort Analysis 

<img width="751" height="397" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-01 at 10 30 54 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f858d8e-b87f-412a-968c-01ab661b5e5a" />

Cohort size: ~27.4k customers have made at least one completed order.

Second-order retention: Only 3.2k customers (≈11.8%) came back for a second purchase.

One-time buyers dominate: Nearly 9 out of 10 customers churn after their first order, showing a heavy reliance on first-time acquisition rather than repeat business.

Growth opportunity: Even a modest uplift in repeat purchase rate (e.g., from ~12% → 20%) would translate into thousands of extra orders without acquiring new customers.

### 🚚 Shipping & Delivery Efficiency Insights

The business is running a fairly quick order cycle: from purchase to delivery in under 4 days on average.

The largest chunk of time is in transit (≈2 days) rather than internal processing (≈1 day).

With 31k completed orders, this looks like a stable operational baseline rather than an outlier.

Conversion rates are stable across channels (~26–27%)
– Very little variance between Email, Adwords, Social, and Organic.
– Suggests product appeal is strong regardless of entry point.

Email drives the largest volume
– 306k sessions, 52k orders, the top contributor to sales.
– Strong retention or customer list quality is a likely factor.

Adwords is the second-largest driver
– 203k sessions, 39k orders.
– Paid acquisition is performing as well as Email in terms of CVR, but likely more costly.

### 🔑 Key Insights

- **Browsing dominates** → ~60% of all events are product or department views, showing customers spend significant time exploring before purchase.  
- **Strong cart engagement** → ~25% of events involve adding items to the cart, indicating high intent to buy.  
- **Purchase conversion** → ~7.5% of all events result in a purchase, which is relatively healthy given the browsing-heavy behavior.  
- **Cancellations matter** → 5% of events are cancellations, suggesting a need to optimize the post-purchase experience (returns, refunds, order accuracy).  

### 📈 Strategic Implications

- Improve **product discovery** (search, recommendations, navigation) to shorten the path from browse → cart.

### 🔑 Key Insights

- **Anonymous visitors dominate browsing**  
  - 500k product views and 250k cart actions are from users who never log in.  
  - They also generate all **cancellation events (124k)**, suggesting they attempt transactions but often churn.  

- **Purchases only happen with logged-in users**  
  - All 182k purchase events are from known users — logging in is a requirement to complete checkout.  

- **Known users engage more deeply**  
  - Even though they generate fewer total events than visitors, logged-in users show balanced activity across browsing, carting, and purchasing.  
  - The **homepage (87k events)** is mainly visited by known users, possibly as part of return sessions.
### 🔑 Balanced Strategy

- **Guest Checkout = Capture Revenue Now**  
  - Prevents losing sales from high-intent anonymous visitors.  
- **Membership System = Build Retention Later**  
  - Encourages guest buyers to convert into loyal, trackable customers.
